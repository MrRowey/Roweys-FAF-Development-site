Since ive Started to under go this Project thing ahev moved left and right to the point were progress is being made now, I want to Layout some of the next main steps to getting a public site up and running for viewing data first.

## Plan to get beta 1.0.0 out
- [ ] Add All Data From the Excel Sheet in to the MySQL Database.
- [ ] Start to add the SQL Statements for all the tables for more Cohernate data for visualisation.
- [ ] Baisc Data SQL Staments are Completed.
- [ ] Re Desgin Current Frontend to represent Basic data.
- [ ] Add Chart.js for future intergration
- [ ] Push Beta 1.0

Once the Beta 1.0 is out i can then have people looks at the site and present feadback and any idea that other may have i cna try to imppemt them in feature patches.

The Next Stage will be to implemte an ManagerDashboard that will be limited to a small few people to be able to Add in New Tournament Data to keep the data growing. 

I would like to jsut also say a Huge Props to Hemfast for collating all the data and hopfull this will make thing easy to keep adding to for furutre tournamets.
