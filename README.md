I was provided by a player who has collected 1v1 data from all the tournaments since 2015, into an Excel spreadsheet with a basic page to get some data out of it all.

My aim is to create a database that sorts all this information, which will be available via a webfront end.

the site is now being hoest by heroku [here](https://rowey-development.herokuapp.com/) to be able to the dynamic parts of the site as git page only deals with static pages.

The Data that's available from the Excel sheet consists of :
- Players Names
- Win Condition
- Finals Match
- Faction Selection
- Map Selection
- Tournament name
- Replay Id
- Year of Tournament
- Prize Money
